## What's Here

A work-in-progress 2.5D graphics engine, **tightly coupled** with
my Ludum Dare 57 submission **Layered**. Try it out [here](https://www.caer.cc/app/ld57).

This crate builds off of the following crates:

1. [`codas`](https://www.crates.io/crates/codas): Code and data processing.
2. [`macroquad`](https://macroquad.rs): 2D graphics engine.
